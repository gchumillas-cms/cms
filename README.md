# Universal Content Management System (UCMS)

This application allows us to manage the contents of **ANY** website, not matter how it was built. That's because, unlike other CMS, this application doesn't manage the "website contents", but the "database contents". That is, you can build your website by using your favorite framework or library and then you can install this application to manage its contents.

The application was mainly developed in **PHP, MySQL and jQuery** and it has multiple configuration options.

## Sections, Subsections and Tables

The website contents are distributed in sections, subsections and finally tables. And each section or subsection may contain one or more tables, from which we can insert, edit, delete, filter and sort records.

## Integrated image editor

The application has an integrated image editor from which we can perform various actions, such as zooming, reducing or trimming images.

## Integrated video editor

The application also has an integrated video editor, from which we can upload videos and take screenshots. The videos are optionally converted to different formats. For example, you can upload an MP4 video and then create an OGG and AVI video. That way we ensure that the video can be played on different devices.
